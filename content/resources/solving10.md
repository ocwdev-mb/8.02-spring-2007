description: This resource tells to introduce the "displacement current" term that
  Maxwell added to Ampere?s Law, to find the magnetic field inside a charging cylindrical
  capacitor using this new term in Ampere?s Law, to introduce the concept of energy
  flow through space in the electromagnetic field, to quantify that energy flow by
  introducing the Pointing vector and to do a calculation of the rate at which energy
  flows into a capacitor when it is charging, and show that it accounts for the rate
  at which electric energy stored in the capacitor is increasing.
