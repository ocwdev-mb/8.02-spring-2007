  caption: "Magnet Levitating Above A Superconducting Ring: The image shows a permanent\
    \ magnet levitating above a conducting non-magnetic ring with zero resistance.\
    \ The magnet is levitated by eddy currents induced in the ring by the approaching\
    \ magnet. These currents are always such as to repel the magnet, by Lenz's Law.\
