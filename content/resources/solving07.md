description: This resource tells about to explore a particular situation that can
  lead to a changing magnetic flux through the open surface bounded by an electric
  circuit, to calculate the rate of change of magnetic flux through the open surface
  bounded by that circuit in this situation, to determine the sense of the induced
  current in the circuit from Lenz?s Law and to look at the forces on the current
  carrying wires in our circuit and determine the effects of these forces on the dynamics
  of the circuit.
