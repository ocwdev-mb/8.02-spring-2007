description: This resource tell about To look at the behavior of a charged particle
  in a uniform magnetic field by studying the operation of a mass spectrometer, to
  calculate the torque on a rectangular loop of current-carrying wire sitting in an
  external magnetic field and define the magnetic dipole moment of a loop of current-carrying
  wire and write the torque on the loop in terms of that vector and the external magnetic
  field.
